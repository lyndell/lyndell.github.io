# Distraction Free

When vibrate isn't enough, nor DND, use Airplane Mode.  The radios of the phone are turned off, saving power and cutting off **all** distractions, except for any alarms or alerts configured.  Phone is usable, but no calls, emails, text messages.

Swipe up from the bottom and click the airplane icon.
