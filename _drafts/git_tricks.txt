git remote add office ssh://username@hostname:2222/home/bram/.repository
So this adds a remote repository behind port 2222 of the host, immediately followed by the remote path of the repository. The ssh:// part is crucial and forgetting this part has cost already some minutes of my life.

Changing a remote's URL
The git remote set-url command changes an existing remote repository URL.

The git remote set-url command takes two arguments:

An existing remote name, for example, origin
A new URL for the remote, for example:
https://github.com/user/repo2.git if you're updating to use HTTPS
git@github.com:user/repo2.git if you're updating to use SSH
For example:

git remote -v
# View existing remotes
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/repo2.git
# Change the 'origin' remote's URL

git remote -v
# Verify new remote URL
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo2.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo2.git (push)
