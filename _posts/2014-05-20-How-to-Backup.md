# Why

The reason to backup is to recover from an unfortunatley event that destroys your data.  What would happen if your files suddenly disappeared?  You would have to redo your work.  You could re-rip you CDs and DVDs, redownload content purchases online.  However, you cannot retake your photos.  

# Concept

Backups automatically copies the files to another locaiton.  If the medium holding the origina file failes, you have a copy elsewhere on a different medium and location.
